      <h2>Common MIME Type Errors in React</h2>

      <p>Two frequent MIME type errors you might encounter are:</p>

      <CodeBlock fileName="Browser console" language="plaintext" disableLineNumbers>
        {`Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. main.jsx:1

Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. app.tsx:1`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>First, check your build/ dist files</h2>

      <p>
        {`A typical build for a simple React site should result in optimized, production-ready files. After
        running the build process, you'll generally find a `}
        <code>dist</code> or <code>build</code>
        {` directory containing these files.
        Whether you've used TypeScript, Tailwind, Less, or other libraries and packages, the output should
        boil down to three main files: an index.html (the entry point), a CSS file, and a plain JavaScript
        file. However, you could have more files, depending on your bundler and the complexity of your
        project.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {`The main CSS and JavaScript files will be minified (read: a chaotic hell of baffling code), and the
        filename will contain an 8-character hash, which ensures that browsers won't try to use old cached
        versions of your styles and scripts. Here's the build structure for a typical small project.`}
      </p>

      <CodeBlock fileName="Vite React project structure" language="plaintext" disableLineNumbers>
        {`dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/

      <h2>Solution: Remove .JSX extensions from source code import statements</h2>

      <p>
        The most common cause of these errors is really annoyingly simple, which is what motivated me to write
        this article.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock fileName="Console error" language="plaintext" disableLineNumbers>
        {`index-fWGo7SiS.js:1 Failed to load module`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p className="bg-green-200">
        If you encounter a MIME type error in the console referencing a specific file, e.g.,{' '}
        <code>App.tsx:1</code>, search your entire codebase for instances where you (or your IDE) might have
        unintentionally added the <code>.tsx</code>, <code>.tsx</code>, or <code>.ts</code>
        extensions to your imports.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Visual Studio Code, use <code>Shift Command F</code> on a Mac, or <code>Shift Ctrl F</code> on
        Windows to perform a project-wide search.
      </p>

        {`I love using Vite - it's fantastic and well-maintained (`}
        <code>create-react-app</code> was depreciated on June 23, 2023). Still, these errors could be avoided
        altogether if import file extensions were enforced. Other frameworks like Next.js do enforce this
        using ESLint.
      </p>

      <h2>File Extensions in React: Best Practices</h2>

      <p>{`Here's an example demonstrating best practices:`}</p>

      <CodeBlock fileName="MyComponent.tsx" language="tsx">
        {`// âœ…
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // No extension
import { helperFunction } from './utils'; // No extension

// ðŸš«
import BadComponent from './BadComponent.jsx'; // Don't include .jsx
import { badHelper } from './badUtils.ts'; // Don't include .ts or .tsx

// âœ… Include the extension for CSS modules
import styles from './styles.module.css';

// âœ… Include the extension for non-JavaScript/TypeScript assets
import logo from './logo.svg';
import data from './data.json';

export default function App() {
    // Your component logic here
}`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        By understanding these common issues and following best practices for file extensions, you can avoid
        MIME type errors in your React applications.
