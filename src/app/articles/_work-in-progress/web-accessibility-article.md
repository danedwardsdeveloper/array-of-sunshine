While checklists based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are essential tools, true accessibility goes deeper. It's about creating genuinely inclusive experiences for all users.

## Key Areas to Focus On

Empathy: Put yourself in the shoes of users with disabilities. How might they experience your website or app if they use screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies?
Semantic HTML: Write code that prioritizes meaning. Use elements like header, nav, main, and article to give structure and context.
Image Descriptions: Don't neglect alt text. Provide meaningful descriptions for images, especially those conveying information.
Color Contrast: Ensure your color choices have sufficient contrast ratios to meet WCAG guidelines. This is essential for users with low vision.
Keyboard Navigation: Test if all features of your site are operable without a mouse. Keyboard accessibility is vital for many users.
Beyond the Technical

User Testing: Involve people with disabilities in testing. Their feedback is the best measure of how accessible your site really is.
Inclusive Language: Use clear, respectful language in your content. Avoid ableist terms and stereotypes.
Why Prioritize Accessibility?

Ethical Responsibility: Everyone deserves equal access to the web.
Greater Reach: Accessible design expands your potential audience.
Improved UX for All: Accessibility practices often lead to a better experience for everyone, not just those with disabilities.
