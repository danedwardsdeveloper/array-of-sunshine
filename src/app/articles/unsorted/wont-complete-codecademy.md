I invested in a year of access to Codecademy's Full-Stack Pathway, excited to land a web development job. But after diving in and using the platform every day for over 6 months, I realised it wasn't the perfect one-size-fits-all solution I'd envisioned. Here's why I'm changing my approach, and why you might consider doing the same.

### Love the platform, but here's the catch

Codecademy _is_ fantastic. It's engaging, well-structured, and a great introduction to coding. Their popularity is well-deserved. However, every tool has its limitations.

### The certificate trap and the importance of focus

The Full-Stack Pathway promises a shiny certificate at the end. Unfortunately, that certificate holds little weight in the job market - the real prize lies in developing your skills and building a strong portfolio. Think about it - would you rather interview someone with a generic certificate (that could easily be faked or bought) or someone whose portfolio showcases their ability to solve real-world problems using the technologies companies use on a daily basis?

### Focus on your goals, not just completing the course

Inspired by this [School of Life YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJhUs1L_RQo) and concepts explored further in the fabulous book [What They Forgot To Teach You At School](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-They-Forgot-Teach-School/dp/1912891395), I decided to step back and think carefully about what I want to achieve, and how I’m going to achieve it. As alluring as the prospect of seeing the course progress bar reach 100% is, that won’t be happening for me.

### Why we need to finally leave school:

-  **Lingering Student Mentality:** Even after formal schooling ends, people may subconsciously crave external validation and approval from authority figures. They might feel a need to follow the rules set by others instead of pursuing their own path. But authority is not necessarily benign: schools and teachers are likely looking after their own needs more than they are yours.
-  **Questioning External Measures of Success:** The School of Life criticises the idea that exams and grades are the ultimate measure of worth. They argue for finding your own internal sense of fulfilment rather than relying on external validation.
-  **There is no perfect curriculum:** Leaving the metaphorical school requires embracing the uncertain and messy nature of life. It's about taking risks and learning from experience rather than seeking the false comfort of a clear-cut path.
-  **Challenging the Myth of Complete Knowledge:** Schools (and Codecademy) subtly perpetuate the idea that everything worth knowing is already known, and you only have to study hard, reach 100% course progress, and then you’ll be perfect. This is simply not true, especially in computer programming. There's always more to discover, understand, invent, and build. Nothing is perfect yet, and everything can always be improved.

### Skip the Fluff, Prioritise what Matters

I won't be completing every aspect of the course, and I won’t be collecting a certificate. I might get to 90%, perhaps - here's what I’ll be missing out:

-  **Useless Projects:** Some projects simply won't impress potential employers. I’m focussed on building useful websites that demonstrate my skills and solve a real-life problem, relevant to the jobs I want to apply for.
-  **Broken Assessments:** Bug-infested assessments can be frustrating and a waste of time.
-  **Outdated Course Material:** Codecademy can be slow to keep up with fast-paced technology (like React and Redux). Learning from official documentation might be less user-friendly, but the content is more relevant.
-  **Streak Obsession:** Codecademy is highly gamified, but don't get caught up in maintaining a daily streak. Taking breaks to focus on portfolio projects is crucial if you want to be employable, and ultimately, they don’t have an actual prize to offer you.

### Learn What You Need, Not What They Teach

If you're serious about landing a coding job, delve into real job descriptions. Find out the specific technologies companies are looking for, and include them in your learning plan. Remember, Codecademy aims for a broad audience, not the specific needs of the job market in your area.

## A Launchpad, Not a Destination

**Codecademy is a valuable learning platform, and I've gained a lot from using it, but it's not a magic bullet - I won’t be wasting my time on course content that doesn’t align with my goals. Don’t let Codecademy’s business objectives disrupt your coding ambitions.**
