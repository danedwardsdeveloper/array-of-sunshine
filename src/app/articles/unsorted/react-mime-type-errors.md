If you're encountering MIME type errors while working with React, you're not alone. These errors can be frustrating, but they're often easily solved. In this article, I'll explore common MIME type errors in React applications and provide practical solutions.

## Common MIME Type Errors in React

Two frequent MIME type errors you might encounter are:

```txt
// Browser console

Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. main.jsx:1

Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. app.tsx:1
```

## First, check your Build/ Dist Files

A typical build for a simple React site should result in a set of optimized, production-ready files. After running the build process, you'll generally find a `dist` or `build` directory containing these files. Whether youâ€™ve used TypeScript, Tailwind, Less, or any other number of libraries and packages, the output should boil down to just three main files: an index.html (the entry point), a CSS file, and a plain JavaScript file. However, you could have more files, depending on your bundler and the complexity of your project.

The main CSS and JavaScript files will be minified (read: a chaotic hell of baffling code) and contain an 8-digit hash, which ensures that browsers wonâ€™t try to use old cached versions of your styles and scripts. Hereâ€™s the build structure for a â€™Coming soonâ€™ page I built for my pop song rights marketplace, [songshop.io](http://songshop.io) as an example.

```txt
// Vite React build directory

dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-ABCD1234_.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-DdzUmU42.js
â”œâ”€â”€ image.webp
â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

## Solution: Remove .JSX Extensions from Source Code Import Statements

I think the most common cause for these errors is really annoyingly simple, which is what has motivated me to write this article.

`index-fWGo7SiS.js:1 Failed to load module `

If you encounter a MIME type error referencing a specific file (e.g., 'App.jsx:1' in the console), search your entire codebase for instances where you (or your IDE) might have unintentionally added the `.jsx`, `.tsx`, or `.ts` extensions to your imports.

In Visual Studio Code, use `Shift + Command + F` (or `Shift + Ctrl + F` on Windows) to perform a project-wide search for `.jsx` extensions.

I love using Vite - itâ€™s fantastic, and very well maintained, (remember, create-react-app was depreciated on June 23, 2023). Still, these errors could be avoided altogether if import file extensions were enforced.

## File Extensions in React: Best Practices

Here's an example demonstrating best practices for both JSX and TSX:

```jsx
// MyComponent.jsx

// Good âœ…
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // No extension
import { helperFunction } from './utils'; // No extension

// Bad ðŸš«
import BadComponent from './BadComponent.jsx'; // Don't include .jsx
import { badHelper } from './badUtils.ts'; // Don't include .ts or .tsx

// For CSS modules, include the extension âœ…
import styles from './styles.module.css';

// When using non-JavaScript assets, include the extension âœ…
import logo from './logo.svg';
import data from './data.json';

export default function App() {
	// Your component logic here
}
```

**Conclusion**

By understanding these common issues and following best practices for file extensions, you can avoid MIME type errors in your React applications. Remember to keep your imports clean, and always read the error message properly.
