Always looking for ways to advance my career, I recently picked up John Sonmez's "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide". This massive tome promises to be a comprehensive resource for programmers at all stages of their careers. After spending considerable time with this weighty book (both literally and figuratively), I'm here to share my thoughts, insights, and whether I think it's worth your time and shelf space.

## First Impressions

Firstly, this book is enormous! Measuring 23.5 x 19 x 4.5cm and weighing a hefty 1.361 kg, it's not exactly a book you'd casually toss in your bag for some light reading on your commute. However, its size is somewhat justified by the breadth of topics it covers.

I say 'somewhat' justified, because inside, the generous use of white space contributes to the book's substantial size, even if it does make for a a pleasant reading experience, making the material much more manageable. As someone who often feels overwhelmed by cluttered pages, I appreciated this design choice.

The cover design too is particularly striking and immediately caught my eye. As someone who appreciates good graphic design, I found the combination of orange and white text on a black background striking and attractive. It's a color scheme I'll definitely keep in mind for future web design projects.

## Content and Structure

Sonmez covers an impressive range of topics relevant to a software developer's career. From getting started in the field to advancing your career and even branching out into specialized areas like game development, he leaves few stones unturned. The book is divided into several main sections:

1. Getting Started as a Software Developer
2. Getting a Job
3. What You Need to Know about Software Development
4. Working as a Developer
5. Advancing Your Career

Each section is further broken down into chapters that tackle specific topics. This structure makes it easy to navigate to the areas most relevant to your current career stage or interests.

## Writing Style and Tone

Sonmez's writing style is conversational and accessible, which helps make the technical content more approachable. However, this informal tone is a double-edged sword. While it can make the reading experience less dry, it also leads to repetition and unnecessary wordiness at times. I found myself wishing he would get to the point more quickly in some chapters.

That said, Sonmez does inject humor into his writing, which helps break up the dense material. For instance, his chapter on DevOps (page 332) had me chuckling, proving that even a career guide can have its moments of levity.

## My Key Takeaways

Despite its verbosity, the book offers numerous valuable insights. Here are some of the key takeaways I found particularly useful:

1. **Learning New Technologies:**
   Sonmez advises getting a broad overview before diving into the details when learning a new technology. This approach helps you understand the big picture and how different components fit together before getting lost in the minutiae.

2. Interview Preparation: Contrary to the casual image often associated with tech companies, Sonmez recommends wearing a suit to interviews. His argument is that while the dress code might be casual, your clothes still say a lot about you, and coming across as a professional can only work in your favor.

3. Resume Crafting: Sonmez takes a somewhat controversial stance on resumes. He suggests hiring a professional resume writer, arguing that your resume should stand out. Interestingly, he advises against listing every language and framework you've ever touched, suggesting instead to focus on the ones you know best. The idea is to avoid coming across as a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

4. Salary Negotiation: The book emphasizes the importance of always negotiating your salary and benefits. Sonmez provides strategies for negotiation and reminds readers to consider the total compensation package, not just the base salary.

5. Job Search Strategies: One interesting piece of advice is to try and have multiple job offers simultaneously. Sonmez argues this can be hugely advantageous, giving you more leverage in negotiations and more options to choose from.

6. Dealing with Recruiters: The book offers valuable insights into the world of tech recruiters, warning readers to be cautious and educating them on different types of recruiters in the software industry.

7. Specialization vs. Generalization: Sonmez advises learning enough to call yourself a full-stack developer, then specializing in one area. This balanced approach can make you more versatile while still having a standout skill set.

8. Blogging for Career Advancement: One of Sonmez's strongest recommendations is to create a blog. He argues it's an excellent way to showcase your skills and passion for programming, acting as a 24/7 advertisement for your abilities. He advises making your blog very niche to establish yourself as an authority in a specific area.

## Criticisms and Drawbacks

While the book offers a wealth of information, it's not without its flaws:

1. Self-Promotion: Perhaps the most glaring issue is Sonmez's constant plugging of his other books, courses, and products. While some self-promotion is expected, the frequency here is excessive. It's particularly annoying when he repeatedly references material that requires additional payment to access, without being upfront about this requirement in any of the promotional material.

While this isn't too much of a problem in print (I learned very quickly to ignore all the links), it must be very annoying on the audio book, as the [hilarious bad reviews](link...) make very clear.

2. Work-Life Balance: Some of Sonmez's advice on work-life balance seems unrealistic. For instance, his suggestion to "get up an hour earlier" (page 501) to fit more into your day might not be practical or healthy for everyone.

3. Length and Repetition: At times, the book feels unnecessarily long. Some concepts are repeated multiple times, and certain chapters could have been condensed without losing their core message.

4. Bragging about how much he earns.

Is It Worth Reading?

Despite its drawbacks, "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" does offer value, especially for those early in their careers or looking to make a significant career move. The comprehensive coverage of topics ensures that readers will find at least some sections relevant to their situation.

However, I would caution against paying full price for a new copy. Much of the information can be found online for free, and the physical size of the book makes it somewhat impractical. If you can find a cheap second-hand copy or borrow it from a library, it's worth reading.

My recommendation would be to review the table of contents and focus on the areas where you feel least confident. Use the book as a starting point to identify areas where you need to improve, then supplement your learning with more up-to-date online resources.

## Final Thoughts

John Sonmez's "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" is a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers a wealth of information and advice for software developers at various stages of their careers. The breadth of topics covered is impressive, and Sonmez's experience in the field shines through in his practical advice.

On the other hand, the book's excessive self-promotion, occasional unrealistic advice, and sheer size may be off-putting to some readers. The writing, while accessible, could benefit from tighter editing to reduce repetition and improve focus.

One aspect that particularly stood out to me was Sonmez's emphasis on personal branding and self-promotion. While this approach has clearly worked well for him (he mentions earning several million from his books and courses), it may not align with everyone's personality or career goals. It's important to remember that there are many paths to success in software development, and what works for one person may not work for another.

That said, the book does offer valuable insights into many aspects of a software developer's career that are often overlooked in more technically focused resources. From negotiating job offers to dealing with workplace politics, Sonmez covers a lot of ground that can be genuinely helpful for developers looking to advance their careers.

In conclusion, while "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" has its flaws, it remains a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to navigate the complex world of software development careers. Just be prepared to sift through some repetition and self-promotion to get to the valuable nuggets of wisdom. And remember, as with any career advice, take what resonates with you and feels authentic to your personal goals and values.

Whether you're just starting out in your software development career or looking to take the next step, this book can provide food for thought and strategies to consider. Just don't expect it to be the only resource you'll need on your journey to becoming a successful software developer.
